# Scene Understanding Challenge for Autonomous Navigation in Unstructured Environments

Code for working with the dataset used for the [Scene Understanding Challenge for Autonomous Navigation in Unstructured Environments](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/scene-understanding-challenge-2018/). For details of getting the dataset and updates see:

- http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/scene-understanding-challenge-2018/ 
- http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/autonue2018/

**For using first add helpers/ to $PYTHONPATH**

**The code has been tested on python 3.6.4**

## Dataset Structure

The structure is similar to the cityscapes dataset. That is:
- gtFine/{split}/{drive_no}/{6 digit img_id}_gtFine_polygons.json for ground truths
- leftImg8bit/{split}/{drive_no}/{6 digit img_id}_leftImg8bit.png for image frames

Furthermore for training, label masks needs to be generated as described bellow resulting in the following files:
- gtFine/{split}/{drive_no}/{6 digit img_id}_gtFine_labellevel3Ids.png
- gtFine/{split}/{drive_no}/{6 digit img_id}_gtFine_instancelevel3Ids.png

## Labels

See helpers/anue_labels.py

## Generate Label Masks (for training/evaluation)

python preperation/createLabels.py --datadir $ANUE --id-type $IDTYPE --color [True|False] --instance [True|False] --num-workers $C

- ANUE is the path to the AutoNUE dataset
- IDTYPE can be id, csId, csTrainId, level3Id, level2Id, level1Id. 
- color True  generates the color masks
- instance True generates the instance masks with the id given by IDTYPE
- C is the number of threads to run in parallel

For the semantic segmentation challenge, masks should be generated using IDTYPE of level3Id and used for training models (similar to trainId in cityscapes). This can be done by the command:

python preperation/createLabels.py --datadir $ANUE --id-type level3Id --num-workers $C

For the instance segmentation challenge, instance masks should be generated by the following comand:

python preperation/createLabels.py --datadir $ANUE --id-type id --num-workers $C

The generated files:

- _gtFine_labelLevel3Ids.png will be used for semantic segmentation
- _gtFine_instanceids.png will be used for instance segmentation

## Viewer

First generate label masks as described above. To view the ground truths / prediction masks at different levels of heirarchy use:

python viewer/viewer.py ---datadir $ANUE

- ANUE has the folder path to the dataset or prediction masks with similar file/folder structure as dataset.

TODO: Make the color map more sensible.


## Evaluating IoUs

First generate labels masks. Then

python evaluate/evaluate_mIoU.py --gts $GT  --preds $PRED  --num-workers $C

- GT is the folder path of ground truths containing <drive_no>/<img_no>_gtFine_labellevel3Ids.png 
- PRED is the folder paths of predictions with the same folder structure and file names.
- C is the number of threads to run in parallel

## Work in Progress

- instance metrics
- mIoUs at level2 and level1
- viewer tool for masks
